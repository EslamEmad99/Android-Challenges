# Androidchallenges
The idea is we will share a challenge (UI or Functional one) and all will particiate on solving it then will share correct ones 

# How to particiapte 
There will be a folder for each challenge contains descreption of challeng then particiapants will pull code and add their impmentation as sub folder and do PR and it will reviewed till it be accepted as correct one. 

so strucure will be like this 
```
challenge 1 | 
------------- ahmed_solution(folder)
--------------Jone_solution(folder)
--------------description 
--------------final results (will point to best answers and some hints)
```
and so one
